# Machine Learning Notebooks

Housing for ML notebook tutorials. Goal is to write more in depth explanations as text tutorials and use the notebooks below for demonstration. 

## Neural Networks (Tensorflow2)

The below notebooks are written using Tensorflow 2.1.

Current notebooks:

  1. Shrekining.ipynb
  2. TimeSeriesModelling.ipynb
  3. VAE.ipynb
  
#### Shrekining.ipynb

A notebook demonstrating how a Shrek movie script can be generated using an RNN.

#### TimeSeriesModelling.ipynb

A notebook demonstrating time series modelling using windowed datasets in TF. 
The model accepts any combination of 14 input features to predict an output over a specified window of time.

#### VAE.ipynb

A notebook demonstrating a Convolutional Variational AutoEncoder over numerous TF datasets. The model accepts both RGB and 
grayscale datasets. The model can save the input/reconstructed  outputs and generated images as gifs for easy 
visualization. The notebook contains gifs/images of the model generating and reconstructing flowers, Japanese letters, 
horses and humans and even Donald Trump.

## Trees

Current notebooks:

  1. Forests4Forests.ipynb

#### Forests4Forests.ipynb

A notebook exploring decision trees, random forests and gradient boosting trees (using xgboost) on a forest dataset (predicting trees with trees  :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:).

## ML Concepts

Current notebooks:

  1. DimReduction&Proj.ipynb

#### DimReduction&Proj.ipynb

A notebook exploring 4 dimension reduction techniques (2 linear, 2 manifold) on toy sklearn datasets. Projections are made into 2D and 3D spaces to see strengths/weaknesses of the methods.

## TF Certification

Google have launched <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate">TF certification</a>. The exam is spread across 5 categories:

  1. Basic / Simple model
  2. Model from learning dataset
  3. Convolutional Neural Network with real-world image dataset
  4. NLP Text Classification with real-world text dataset
  5. Sequence Model with real-world numeric dataset
  
This <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice">course</a> is cited as the advised preparation for the exam. The notebooks below cover the various aspects of the course. These are not complete tutorials, but more study notes.

  1. DL_part1.ipynb - Part 1 : Category 1 & 2
  2. DL_part2.ipynb - Part 2 : Category 3
  
#### DL_part1.ipynb

Notebook covering the basics of the TF specilization course, part 1, weeks 1 - 4. Includes training a simple model to estimate a linear function, using learning datasets and visualizing convolution outputs.

#### DL_part2.ipynb

Notebook covering CNNs on real-world image datasets. Topics include data augmentation, dropout and transfer learning.

Note: To practice on real-world datasets, one can use the following <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/general/74235">guide</a> for downloading kaggle datasets in colab.
