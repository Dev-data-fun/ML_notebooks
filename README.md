# Machine Learning Notebooks

Housing for ML notebook tutorials. Goal is to write more in depth explanations as text tutorials and use the notebooks below for demonstration. 

## Neural Networks (Tensorflow2)

The below notebooks are written using Tensorflow 2.1.

Current notebooks:

  1. Shrekining.ipynb
  2. TimeSeriesModelling.ipynb
  3. VAE.ipynb
  
#### Shrekining.ipynb

A notebook demonstrating how a Shrek movie script can be generated using an RNN. 

#### TimeSeriesModelling.ipynb

A notebook demonstrating time series modelling using windowed datasets in TF. 
The model accepts any combination of 14 input features to predict an output over a specified window of time.

#### VAE.ipynb

A notebook demonstrating a Convolutional Variational AutoEncoder over numerous TF datasets. The model accepts both RGB and 
grayscale datasets. The model can save the input/reconstructed  outputs and generated images as gifs for easy 
visualization. The notebook contains gifs/images of the model generating and reconstructing flowers, Japanese letters, 
horses and humans and even Donald Trump.

## Trees

Current notebooks:

  1. Forests4Forests.ipynb

#### Forests4Forests.ipynb

A notebook exploring decision trees, random forests and gradient boosting trees (using xgboost) on a forest dataset (predicting trees with trees  :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:).

## ML Concepts

Current notebooks:

  1. DimReduction&Proj.ipynb

#### DimReduction&Proj.ipynb

A notebook exploring 4 dimension reduction techniques (2 linear, 2 manifold) on toy sklearn datasets. Projections are made into 2D and 3D spaces to see strengths/weaknesses of the methods.
