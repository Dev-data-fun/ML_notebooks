Housing for TF notebooks.

Current notebooks:

  1. Shrekining.ipynb
  2. TimeSeriesModelling.ipynb
  3. VAE.ipynb
  
#### Shrekining.ipynb

A notebook demonstrating how a Shrek movie script can be generated using an RNN. 

#### TimeSeriesModelling.ipynb

A notebook demonstrating time series modelling using windowed datasets in TF. 
The model accepts any combination of 14 input features to predict an output over a specified window of time.

#### VAE.ipynb

A notebook demonstrating a Convolutional Variational AutoEncoder over numerous TF datasets. The model accepts both RGB and 
grayscale datasets. The model can save the input/reconstructed  outputs and generated images as gifs for easy 
visualization. The notebook contains gifs/images of the model generating and reconstructing flowers, Japanese letters, 
horses and humans and even Donald Trump.
